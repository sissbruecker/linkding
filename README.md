##  Introduction

linkding is a bookmark manager that you can host yourself.
It's designed be to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up using Docker.

The name comes from:
- *link* which is often used as a synonym for URLs and bookmarks in common language
- *Ding* which is German for thing
- ...so basically something for managing your links

**Feature Overview:**
- Clean UI optimized for readability
- Organize bookmarks with tags
- Add notes using Markdown
- Read it later functionality
- Share bookmarks with other users
- Bulk editing
- Automatically provides titles, descriptions and icons of bookmarked websites
- Automatically creates snapshots of bookmarked websites on [the Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)
- Import and export bookmarks in Netscape HTML format
- Installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Extensions for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/linkding-extension/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkding-extension/beakmhbijpdhipnjhnclmhgjlddhidpe), as well as a bookmarklet
- Light and dark themes
- REST API for developing 3rd party apps
- Admin panel for user self-service and raw data access
- Easy setup using Docker and a SQLite database, with PostgreSQL as an option

## Installation

linkding is designed to be run with container solutions like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
The Docker image is compatible with ARM platforms, so it can be run on a Raspberry Pi.

linkding uses an SQLite database by default.
Alternatively linkding supports PostgreSQL, see the [database options](docs/Options.md#LD_DB_ENGINE) for more information.

<details>

<summary>ðŸ§ª Alpine-based image</summary>

The default Docker image (`latest` tag) is based on a slim variant of Debian Linux.
Alternatively, there is an image based on Alpine Linux (`latest-alpine` tag) which has a smaller size, resulting in a smaller download and less disk space required.
The Alpine image is currently about 45 MB in compressed size, compared to about 130 MB for the Debian image.

To use it, replace the `latest` tag with `latest-alpine`, either in the CLI command below when using Docker, or in the `docker-compose.yml` file when using docker-compose.

> [!WARNING]
> The image is currently considered experimental in order to gather feedback and iron out any issues.
> Only use it if you are comfortable running experimental software or want to help out with testing.
> While there should be no issues with creating new installations, there might be issues when migrating existing installations.
> If you plan to migrate your existing installation, make sure to create proper [backups](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/blob/master/docs/backup.md) first.

</details>

###  Using Docker

To install linkding using Docker you can just run the [latest image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sissbruecker/linkding) from Docker Hub:
```shell
docker run --name linkding -p 9090:9090 -v {host-data-folder}:/etc/linkding/data -d sissbruecker/linkding:latest
```

In the command above, replace the `{host-data-folder}` placeholder with an absolute path to a folder on your host system where you want to store the linkding database.

If everything completed successfully, the application should now be running and can be accessed at http://localhost:9090.

To upgrade the installation to a new version, remove the existing container, pull the latest version of the linkding Docker image, and then start a new container using the same command that you used above. There is a [shell script](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/blob/master/install-linkding.sh) available to automate these steps. The script can be configured using environment variables, or you can just modify it.

To complete the setup, you still have to [create an initial user](#user-setup), so that you can access your installation.

###  Using Docker Compose

To install linkding using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you can use the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file. Copy the [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/blob/master/.env.sample) file to `.env`, configure the parameters, and then run:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

To complete the setup, you still have to [create an initial user](#user-setup), so that you can access your installation.

### User Setup

For security reasons, the linkding Docker image does not provide an initial user, so you have to create one after setting up an installation. To do so, replace the credentials in the following command and run it:

**Docker**
```shell
docker exec -it linkding python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

**Docker Compose**
```shell
docker-compose exec linkding python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

The command will prompt you for a secure password. After the command has completed you can start using the application by logging into the UI with your credentials.

Alternatively you can automatically create an initial superuser on startup using the [`LD_SUPERUSER_NAME` option](docs/Options.md#LD_SUPERUSER_NAME).

### Reverse Proxy Setup

When using a reverse proxy, such as Nginx or Apache, you may need to configure your proxy to correctly forward the `Host` header to linkding, otherwise certain requests, such as login, might fail.

<details>
<summary>Apache</summary>

Apache2 does not change the headers by default, and should not
need additional configuration.

An example virtual host that proxies to linkding might look like:
```
<VirtualHost *:9100>
    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    ProxyPass / http://linkding:9090/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://linkding:9090/
</VirtualHost>
```

For a full example, see the docker-compose configuration in [jhauris/apache2-reverse-proxy](https://github.com/jhauris/linkding/tree/apache2-reverse-proxy)

If you still run into CSRF issues, please check out the [`LD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` option](docs/Options.md#LD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Caddy 2</summary>

Caddy does not change the headers by default, and should not need any further configuration.

If you still run into CSRF issues, please check out the [`LD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` option](docs/Options.md#LD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Nginx</summary>

Nginx by default rewrites the `Host` header to whatever URL is used in the `proxy_pass` directive.
To forward the correct headers to linkding, add the following directives to the location block of your Nginx config:
```
location /linkding {
    ...
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

</details>

Instead of configuring header forwarding in your proxy, you can also configure the URL from which you want to access your linkding instance with the  [`LD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` option](docs/Options.md#LD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS).

### Managed Hosting Options

Self-hosting web applications still requires a lot of technical know-how and commitment to maintenance, in order to keep everything up-to-date and secure. This section is intended to provide simple alternatives in form of managed hosting solutions.

### JetBrains

JetBrains has previously provided an open-source license of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for the development of linkding.

## Development

The application is open source, so you are free to modify or contribute. The application is built using the Django web framework. You can get started by checking out the excellent [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/). The `bookmarks` folder contains the actual bookmark application, `siteroot` is the Django root application. Other than that the code should be self-explanatory / standard Django stuff ðŸ™‚.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Node.js

### Setup

Create a virtual environment for the application (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html):
```
python3 -m venv ~/environments/linkding
```
Activate the environment for your shell:
```
source ~/environments/linkding/bin/activate[.csh|.fish]
```
Within the active environment install the application dependencies from the application folder:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements.dev.txt
```
Install frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Initialize database:
```
mkdir -p data
python3 manage.py migrate
```
Create a user for the frontend:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```
Start the Node.js development server (used for compiling JavaScript components like tag auto-completion) with:
```
npm run dev
```
Start the Django development server with:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The frontend is now available under http://localhost:8000

### Tests
