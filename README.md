## Getting Started

The following links help you to get started with linkding:
- [Install linkding on your own server](https://linkding.link/installation) or [check managed hosting options](https://linkding.link/managed-hosting)
- [Install the browser extension](https://linkding.link/browser-extension)
- [Check out community projects](https://linkding.link/community), which include mobile apps, browser extensions, libraries and more

## Documentation

The full documentation is now available at [linkding.link](https://linkding.link/).

If you want to contribute to the documentation, you can find the source files in the `docs` folder.

If you want to contribute a community project, feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/edit/master/docs/src/content/docs/community.md).

## Contributing

Small improvements, bugfixes and documentation improvements are always welcome. If you want to contribute a larger feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it. I may choose to ignore PRs for features that don't align with the project's goals or that I don't want to maintain.

## Development

The application is built using the Django web framework. You can get started by checking out the excellent [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/). The `bookmarks` folder contains the actual bookmark application. Other than that the code should be self-explanatory / standard Django stuff ðŸ™‚.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Node.js

### Setup

Initialize the development environment with:
```
make init
```
This sets up a virtual environment using uv, installs NPM dependencies and runs migrations to create the initial database.

Create a user for the frontend:
```
uv run manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

Run the frontend build for bundling frontend components with:
```
make frontend
```

Then start the Django development server with:
```
make serve
```
The frontend is now available under http://localhost:8000

### Tests

Run all tests with pytest:
```
make test
```

### Formatting

Format Python code with black, and JavaScript code with prettier:
```
make format
```

### DevContainers

> [!WARNING]
> The dev container setup is currently broken after switching to uv.
> Feel free to contribute a PR if you want to fix it.
> The instructions below are outdated until then.

This repository also supports DevContainers: [![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding.git)

Once checked out, only the following commands are required to get started:

Create a user for the frontend:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```
Start the Node.js development server (used for compiling JavaScript components like tag auto-completion) with:
```
npm run dev
```
Start the Django development server with:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The frontend is now available under http://localhost:8000
