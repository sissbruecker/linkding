##  Introduction

linkding is a bookmark manager that you can host yourself.
It's designed be to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up using Docker.

The name comes from:
- *link* which is often used as a synonym for URLs and bookmarks in common language
- *Ding* which is German for thing
- ...so basically something for managing your links

## Documentation

The full documentation is now available at [linkding.link](https://linkding.link/).

If you want to contribute to the documentation, you can find the source files in the `docs` folder.

If you want to contribute a community project, feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/edit/master/docs/src/content/docs/community.md).

## Contributing

Small improvements, bugfixes and documentation improvements are always welcome. If you want to contribute a larger feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it. I may choose to ignore PRs for features that don't align with the project's goals or that I don't want to maintain.

## Development

The application is built using the Django web framework. You can get started by checking out the excellent [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/). The `bookmarks` folder contains the actual bookmark application. Other than that the code should be self-explanatory / standard Django stuff 🙂.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- Node.js

### Setup

Create a virtual environment for the application (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html):
```
python3 -m venv ~/environments/linkding
```
Activate the environment for your shell:
```
source ~/environments/linkding/bin/activate[.csh|.fish]
```
Within the active environment install the application dependencies from the application folder:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements.dev.txt
```
Install frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Initialize database:
```
mkdir -p data
python3 manage.py migrate
```
Create a user for the frontend:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```
Start the Node.js development server (used for compiling JavaScript components like tag auto-completion) with:
```
npm run dev
```
Start the Django development server with:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The frontend is now available under http://localhost:8000

### Tests

Run all tests with pytest:
```
make test
```

### Formatting

Format Python code with black, and JavaScript code with prettier:
```
make format
```

### DevContainers

This repository also supports DevContainers: [![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding.git)

Once checked out, only the following commands are required to get started:

Create a user for the frontend:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```
Start the Node.js development server (used for compiling JavaScript components like tag auto-completion) with:
```
npm run dev
```
Start the Django development server with:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The frontend is now available under http://localhost:8000
