Collection of tips and tricks around using linkding.

## Using the bookmarklet on Android/Chrome

This how-to explains the usage of the standard linkding bookmarklet on Android / Chrome. 

Chrome on Android does not permit running bookmarklets in the same way you can on a desktop system. There is however a workaround that is explained here.

**Note** that this only works with Chrome and not with other browsers on Android.

Create a bookmark of your linkding deployment by clicking the star icon which you find in the three dots menu in the top right. Next you have to edit the bookmark. Edit the URL and replace it it with the bookmarklet code of your instance and give it an easy to type name like `bm` for bookmark or `ld` for linkding:

```
javascript:window.open(`http://<YOUR_INSTANCE_HERE>/bookmarks/new?url=${encodeURIComponent(window.location)}&auto_close`)
```

Now when you are browsing the web and you want to save the current page as a bookmark to your linkding instance simply type `bm` into the address bar and select it from the results. The bookmarklet code will trigger and you will be redirected so save the current page.

## Using HTTP Shortcuts app on Android

- Copy the URL of [linkding_shortcut.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sissbruecker/linkding/master/docs/src/assets/linkding_shortcut.json).

- Open HTTP Shortcuts, tap the 3-dot-button at the top-right corner, tap `Import/Export`, then tap `Import from URL`.

- Paste the URL you copied earlier, tap OK, go back, tap the 3-dot-button again, then tap `Variables`.

## Increase the font size

The font size can be adjusted globally by adding the following CSS to the custom CSS field in the settings:

```css
:root {
  --font-size: 0.75rem;
  --font-size-sm: 0.7rem;
  --font-size-lg: 0.9rem;
}

.bookmark-list {
  line-height: 1.15rem;
}

.tag-cloud {
  line-height: 1.15rem;
}
```

You can adjust the `--font-size`, `--font-size-sm` and `--font-size-lg` variables to your liking.
Note that increasing the font might also require you to adjust the line-height in certain places to better separate texts from each other.
As an example, the above also increases the font size and line height of the bookmark list and tag cloud.
