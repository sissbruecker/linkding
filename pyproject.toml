# For PostgreSQL support, use the binary release for development so that not
# everyone needs to build from source. For production, use a separate dependency
# group that builds the driver from source. uv also needs to build it from
# source to update the lockfile, which requires libpq. On macOS:
# - brew install libpq
# - export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"
# - uv add --group postgres psycopg[c]
